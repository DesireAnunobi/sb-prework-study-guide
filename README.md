# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for Front-End Web Developer boot camp students who were going through the pre-work. The website was built to teach us about the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. We used the Console to inspect and debug code. I learnt more about Git, Javascript and how to use Git Bash instead of the terminal on VS code.
